Dialogue: 0,0:13:25.28,0:13:28.06,Main,SM,0,0,0,,So you're suggesting that it was planned?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:28.06,0:13:31.59,Main,Gs,0,0,0,,At least to the extent that \Nit tried to chase us away,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.15,0:13:34.90,Main,Gs,0,0,0,,and it also attacked the goblins.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.35,0:13:40.06,Main,SM,0,0,0,,That seems a bit paranoid.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:14.96,0:14:18.13,Main,SM,0,0,0,,To think that the messenger of \Nthe Supreme God should protect

Dialogue: 0,0:15:36.53,0:15:37.65,Main,Sm,0,0,0,,But...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:38.31,0:15:39.93,Main,SM,0,0,0,,Who could I have asked?

Dialogue: 0,0:15:58.35,0:16:00.02,Main,GS,0,0,0,,Because you're not a goblin.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:01.55,0:16:04.29,Main,SM,0,0,0,,Is that why you're not going to ask why?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:06.05,0:16:07.59,Main,GS,0,0,0,,If you want to tell me, I'll listen.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:10.94,0:16:13.00,Main,SM,0,0,0,,I wanted someone to understand.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:34.91,0:16:39.30,Main,SM,0,0,0,,But in the end, no one did.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:20.06,0:17:21.09,Main,GS,0,0,0,,Perhaps.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:21.73,0:17:25.11,Main,SM,0,0,0,,May I ask you something, as well?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:25.51,0:17:27.51,Main,GS,0,0,0,,I can't promise you an answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:27.51,0:17:31.77,Main,SM,0,0,0,,Has something changed since you \Nstarted slaying the goblins?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:32.95,0:17:33.93,Main,GS,0,0,0,,Something?

Dialogue: 0,0:18:24.09,0:18:27.64,Main,SM,0,0,0,,So you're not going to save me?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:28.01,0:18:28.66,Main,GS,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:33.32,0:18:34.26,Main,GS,0,0,0,,But...

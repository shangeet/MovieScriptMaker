Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.76,0:17:13.19,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Because this is a place where...
Dialogue: 0,0:17:13.19,0:17:16.10,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,we have to eventually graduate.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:16.10,0:17:18.26,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,There was someone who believed that, huh?

Dialogue: 0,0:17:27.44,0:17:30.14,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's when bugs can start to appear.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:08.52,0:18:11.34,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,There's no possibility of meeting again.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:11.34,0:18:13.89,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It's an astronomical number,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:13.89,0:18:15.66,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,but the odds are not zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:15.66,0:18:19.76,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,However, the time spent waiting for her was too long

Dialogue: 0,0:18:22.36,0:18:26.48,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's why he created a program to turn himself into an NPC.

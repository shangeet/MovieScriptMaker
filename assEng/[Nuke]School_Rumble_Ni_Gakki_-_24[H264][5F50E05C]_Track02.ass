Hige means moustache/beard/whiskers. I'm not quite sure which is the one the speaker is referring Harima as, since 23 was the first SR I saw. Regardless, instead of current translation, I would say "I don't know the whereabouts of the Hige." Then if you translated Hige, you can say such things like "beardy" which I'm not sure how fits Harima.}

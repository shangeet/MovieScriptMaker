Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.56,0:03:56.59,Default,,0,0,0,,That's when the narrative structure itself is used to mislead the reader, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.59,0:03:57.30,Default,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.73,0:04:02.14,Default,,0,0,0,,For the twist you came up with, the cameraman was an unreliable narrator.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.95,0:04:20.07,Default,,0,0,0,,No book about Holmes ever used an unreliable narrator.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.40,0:04:25.37,Default,,0,0,0,,With a few exceptions, that kind of trick only showed up in Christie's era,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.37,0:04:28.33,Default,,0,0,0,,from the turn of the 20th century.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.04,0:04:30.91,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't know Hongou,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.30,0:04:34.04,Default,,0,0,0,,but I doubt she's on Christie's level!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.28,0:04:38.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Personally, I really liked that movie on its own merits.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.16,0:04:40.88,Default,,0,0,0,,And if the twist was yours and yours alone, I'd have no objections!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.26,0:04:45.59,Default,,0,0,0,,But if you claim this is what Hongou intended, I'd have to disagree.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.59,0:04:49.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Wait a moment! We have no way of knowing what else Hongou had read!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.10,0:04:52.73,Default,,0,0,0,,She might've read some other book that included an unreliable narrator!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.07,0:04:54.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Or maybe she saw a movie—

Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.82,0:04:58.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Do you really think so?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.46,0:05:03.96,Default,,0,0,0,,If that's what you honestly believe, I'm okay with that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.34,0:05:08.07,Default,,0,0,0,,That's all I wanted to say.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.73,0:05:53.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Don't worry about it. Ibara and Satoshi gave me an earful about it too.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.54,0:05:55.57,Default,,0,0,0,,They said it couldn't be what Hongou had in mind.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.51,0:06:03.21,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't think it could be either.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.94,0:06:10.01,Default,,0,0,0,,What's your reasoning?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.46,0:06:17.64,Default,,0,0,0,,The sun is still high. Why don't we take a walk on the riverside?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.26,0:06:29.11,Default,,0,0,0,,Oreki, do you know what got me thinking about this case?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.62,0:06:32.85,Default,,0,0,0,,The ending of the movie, I guess.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.85,0:06:34.08,Default,,0,0,0,,That's what started it all.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.58,0:06:35.55,Default,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.55,0:06:40.10,Default,,0,0,0,,I didn't really care how the movie ended.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.10,0:06:43.25,Default,,0,0,0,,That's why I think your theory is really good.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.25,0:06:45.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Then what's the problem?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.25,0:06:49.72,Default,,0,0,0,,I can't get Hongou off my mind.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.02,0:06:54.81,Default,,0,0,0,,This was a really weird case no matter how I looked at it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.81,0:06:57.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Why didn't Irisu ask someone close to Hongou,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.90,0:07:02.62,Default,,0,0,0,,like Eba for instance, about the final twist?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.62,0:07:04.11,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't get it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.60,0:07:06.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Wasn't it because they wanted to give Hongou a rest?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.04,0:07:11.41,Default,,0,0,0,,If you've got an idea of your own, say it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.63,0:07:17.79,Default,,0,0,0,,I think Hongou would have thoroughly planned out the script from start to finish.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.13,0:07:21.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Even if she had to give up writing midway, they could've at least asked her about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.89,0:07:24.13,Default,,0,0,0,,If it was serious enough that they couldn't even do that,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.13,0:07:29.97,Default,,0,0,0,,then Hongou's best friend Eba would have been so furious with her class
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.80,0:07:33.47,Default,,0,0,0,,that she never would have agreed to help them in the first place.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.48,0:07:35.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.64,0:07:43.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Hongou didn't tell the twist to anyone, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.57,0:07:49.03,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe she wanted to write the whole thing on her own.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.28,0:07:53.86,Default,,0,0,0,,From the way they described her, I always imagined Hongou to be fairly timid.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.36,0:07:58.75,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't think she'd be stubborn enough to make the whole class wait.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.75,0:08:02.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Then maybe she wasn't confident about the ending?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.71,0:08:04.67,Default,,0,0,0,,I considered that too.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.97,0:08:07.74,Default,,0,0,0,,But her classmates aren't bad people.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.74,0:08:10.80,Default,,0,0,0,,They wouldn't just throw her ending out the window.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.25,0:08:12.51,Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}Not bad, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.92,0:08:18.77,Default,,0,0,0,,If your ending was what she intended, she would've been confident enough to tell them about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.77,0:08:20.52,Default,,0,0,0,,It was quite well done, after all.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.95,0:08:24.02,Default,,0,0,0,,But I don't think that was the case, which is why she didn't tell them.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.27,0:08:27.73,Default,,0,0,0,,So what was it that cornered her?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.73,0:08:30.07,Default,,0,0,0,,That's what I'm trying to find out.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.45,0:08:34.74,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm sure that if she wasn't able to finish writing it as intended,
